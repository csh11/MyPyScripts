This is a collection of my python scripts

1. centos_epel_install.py -> This script automates the process of installing epel
   packages on centos/RHEL

2. patch_linux.py -> This script checks the flavor of linux thats running and
   patches the system accordingly

3. timesheet_reminder_deca.py ->  This script reminds me that its time to fill
   out my time sheet

4. netping.py -> This script is a cheap network ping sweeper :)
